# Scanning

Here we give the results on KITTI_ROAD_DATASET for our proposed two scanning and image-guided-diffusion based road detection methods, including training and testing data.\
For each result image, the red areas represent the detection result.  

S-DT-GIF: Row and Column Scanning based method with Delaunay Triangulation and Guided Image Filtering.\
S-TGV: Row and Column Scanning based method with Total Generalized Variation.

We also provide some domes for S-TGV:\
